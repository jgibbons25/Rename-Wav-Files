### Automation Script
I created this Python script in the midst of a short film project to automate renaming hundreds of sound files. 

This script crawls through the working directory, including all subfolders. It assumes each sound file has a named layer such as _1, _2, or _3 associated to the mic used to record it. When you execute the script, you can tell it what to rename each layer.

The code will then rename the files, assuming the title of the subfolder is the shot name, and that each take is a collection of all layer files.
